# The main agenda of this is to classify two types of SMS i.e SPAM and HAM. Spam refers to a spam SMS and vice versa.
# Text preprocessing is done using string function. String function is used to remove strings from the text
# Tokenization is done with a custom defined function. It applies the string function, joins the charcters on wide space and removes the stop  words
# TFIDF of bag of words is created using tfidf transformer function
# Machine learning models are applied on the data after splitting
# for simplicity applied multinomial NB model

#second NLP challange is dealt with neural networks.
#The challange is to classify the ratings of the drug, high or low based on the previously genrated corpus
#Used convolutional 2d networks
